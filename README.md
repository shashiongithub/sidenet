> Most extractive summarization methods focus on the main body of the
> document from which sentences need to be extracted.  The gist of the
> document often lies in the side information of the document, such as
> title and image captions. These types of side information are often
> available for newswire articles. We propose to explore side
> information in the context of single document extractive
> summarization. We develop a framework for single-document
> summarization composed of a hierarchical document encoder and an
> attentionbased extractor with attention over side information.  We
> evaluate our models on a large scale news dataset. We show that
> extractive summarization with side information consistently
> outperforms its counterpart (that does not use any side information),
> in terms on both informativeness and fluency.
